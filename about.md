I'm a software engineer specialising in (big)data processing, and past security researcher with a particular interest in fraud prevention and android malware research.  

I am extremely passionate about TDD, and how it drives quality code. At the same time, good quality code created by following SOLID principals enables easier, and cleaner testing.  

This combined with BDD helps split out test layers of responsibility (unit -> integration -> system -> smoke) that ensures no overlap and extendible design.
