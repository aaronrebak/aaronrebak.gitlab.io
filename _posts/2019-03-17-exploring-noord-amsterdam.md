I recently visited Amsterdam for a city break with my girlfriend. It was brilliant. Staying away from tourist trap locations, it was great to see how unique Amsterdam as a city really is.

It was a Saturday when Amsterdam is packed full of stoners, and lads on stag dooes. We decided to go north, crossing the River IJ, to Noord. 
The Noord is a really unique place, once owned by BP; now a derelict industrial place undergoing mass regeneration.  

We caught a ferry (which was free!) over to NDSM. Arriving at the port, we were met with a Soviet Zulu Submarine docked in the harbour.
I looked into how it got here. It was brought to Amsterdam by enthusiasts and later sold to be turned into a night club. It's still for sale!

While there, we were lucky enough to witness the IJ Hallen market that's on once a month.  
This is the biggest flea market in Europe with thousands of stalls selling second hand merchandise. The place was buzzing.

After looking around the Flea Market we decided to make our way over to Veer Buiksloterweg.
We came across some pretty cool stuff en route!
Believe it or not, this crane has actually been converted into a BnB for holiday makers.

While I don't have any decent pictures of De Ceuvel. I really recommend checking it out if in the area.  
Once a highly contaminated plot of land with badly damaged houseboats, it's been restored into an eco friendly hangout consisting of a vibey Cafe striving to serve the most sustainable food and drink (good ales).  
The houseboats have also been refurbed and fitted for people to stay in.

It's also worth mentioning that the Noord is scattered with some amazing graffiti. While there, we managed to snap a few shots of our personal favourites!
