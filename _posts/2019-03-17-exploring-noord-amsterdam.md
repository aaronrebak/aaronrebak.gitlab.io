I recently visited Amsterdam for a city break with my girlfriend. It was brilliant. Staying away from the tourist traps *(red light district)*, it was great to see how unique Amsterdam as a city really is.

It was a Saturday when Amsterdam is packed full with stoners, and lads on stag dooes that we decided to go north, crossing the River IJ, to Noord. We caught a ferry (which was free!) over to NDSM.  

The Noord is a really unique place, once owned by BP, it is now a derelict industrial place undergoing mass regeneration. 

Arriving at NDSM Port was pretty impressive.  
A Soviet Zulu class submarine docked in the harbour - I looked into this and apparently it's for sale. The owners did want to turn it into a night club, but it seems like this plan fell through.

While there, we were lucky enough to witness the IJ Hallen market which is only on once a month.  
This is the biggest flea market in Europe with thousands of stalls selling second hand merchandise.
