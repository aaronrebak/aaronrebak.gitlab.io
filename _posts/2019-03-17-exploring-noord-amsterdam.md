I recently visited Amsterdam for a city break with my girlfriend. It was brilliant. Staying away from the tourist traps *(red light district)*, it was great to see how unique Amsterdam as a city really is.

It was a Saturday when Amsterdam is packed full with stoners, and lads on stag dooes that we decided to go north, crossing the River IJ, to Noord. We caught a ferry (which was free!) over to NDSM.  

Arriving at NDSM Port was pretty impressive.
