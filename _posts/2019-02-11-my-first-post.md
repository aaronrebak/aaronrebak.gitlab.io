Trying to balance work, hobbies, friends, and family sometimes results in little time to explore/work on new personal goals.
Something I've wanted to do for a while is setup a site to blog about my findings, and experience as a software engineer.  
I admit, it took some time to get started (mostly in sittings on long train journeys)!  

> Introducing Jekyll

I wanted a simple, maintainable, and affordable site that elimited the complexities of other blogging platforms. Jekyll answered those requirements; with the ability to build and deploy for free with the help of [Gitlab Pages][gitlab-pages-info], it was a no brainer!

Jekyll is a really awesome static site generator; from someone with a particualar interest in having a *secure* site, I thought the idea of serving static files where nothing dynamic could be exploited was great!

There are many other static site generators built for different purposes. So if Jekyll doesn't suit your needs, then use another that does. You can find out more information about other generators [here][static-site-examples].
